# odin-mini-messageboard
A mini messageboard as part of The Odin Project's NodeJS course.

#### [Live Preview](https://lowpal-odin-mini-messageboard.fly.dev/)

Application runs on fly.io. First time using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) (formally Jade).

Messages are _not_ saved on a database, so redeployment deletes these. Will come back and add messages to a database of some sort (perhaps [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)).
